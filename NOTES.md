### Next steps

#### find identical faces (so that we don't need to calculate each face individually)
 - Find matching edges (length & dihedral)
 - Find matching vertices (dihedrals of all connected edges)
 
#### create 3D version to preview what we are building
 - store the rotation matrix to go back and forth between 2D and 3D -- apply it to our faces at the end of this process and extrude them into shapes!
 



 ### Polygonal faces in Three.js
 Why is this so hard to get? Seems ridiculous.


 ### Properly organize source code 
 I have dumb code organization right now...



### Refactor with numpy / some other 3d toolbelt.
Currently using lists of np.array for vectors which is dumb...
