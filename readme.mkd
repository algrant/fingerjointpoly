## Finger Joint Polyhedra

Generate patterns to build polyhedra using a laser cutter.

### Next steps

#### find identical faces
 - Find matching edges (length & dihedral)
 - Find matching vertices (dihedrals of all connected edges)
 
#### create 3D version to preview what we are building
 - store the rotation matrix to go back and forth between 2D and 3D -- apply it to our faces at the end of this process and extrude them into shapes!
